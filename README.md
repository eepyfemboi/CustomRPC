[a pre-compiled executable for windows can be found by clicking here](https://github.com/eepyfemboi/CustomRPC/releases/tag/2)

don't close the window after running it or else it will stop doing the discord rpc thingie

because i used pyinstaller windows defender and other antivirus software might falsely flag it as malware. if you dont want to or dont know how to set up an exception, or simply dont want to risk it, i would recommend installing python and using the other script.
